# JWT Authentication and Token Management with Spring Boot


## Project Overview

In the dynamic landscape of web application security, this project stands as a testament to modern authentication practices. We've implemented a robust system leveraging JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Spring Boot, and the latest features from Spring Security 6. This project addresses key aspects of user authentication, secure login and logout services, and introduces a seamless refresh token mechanism for prolonged user sessions.

## Key Features

1. **JWT Access Token Security:**
   - Utilize JWT for secure, token-based user authentication.
   - Encode user claims into compact and URL-safe tokens for data integrity and confidentiality.

2. **Login Service Excellence:**
   - Streamlined and secure login experience.
   - Authenticate users and issue JWT access tokens for subsequent API requests.
   - Secure password storage practices using Spring Security.

3. **Logout with Grace:**
   - Robust logout service to gracefully terminate user sessions.
   - Manage token revocation and session cleanup for enhanced security.

4. **Refresh Token Mechanism:**
   - Continuous user sessions without compromising security.
   - Efficient refresh token mechanism for obtaining new access tokens without re-entering credentials.

5. **Spring Security 6 Integration:**
   - Leverage the latest features of Spring Security 6 for advanced security configurations.
   - Benefit from improved security modules, methods, and overall system enhancements.

## Usage

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Clone the project repository:
     ```shell
     git clone [GitHub Repo URL]
     ```

2. **Configure:**
   - Configure application properties, including security settings, in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

3. **Build and Run:**
   - Build and run the Spring Boot application using Maven or Gradle:
     ```shell
     ./mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```

4. **Access and Test:**
   - Access the application through a web browser or API testing tool.
   - Utilize implemented JWT authentication, secure login, logout services, and observe the seamless refresh token mechanism.
